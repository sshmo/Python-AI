# Python-AI
  This Python-AI project includes my code implementation of the corresponding [course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/).


The libraries used in this project are:

  - **csv:** In order to load data from CSV files into memory.
  - **copy:** In order to left the original object unmodified after updating the object.
  - **itertools:** In order to obtain a list of all possible subsets of a set.
  - **pandas:** A data analysis and manipulation tool, used for data cleaning and preparation.
  - **sklearn:** A tool for machine learning implementation in Python, KNeighbors was used in this project.
  - **cv2:** OpenCV library that used for loading and preprocessing image data.
  - **tensorflow, keras:** Tensorflow has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks, used for image recognition.
  - **nltk** A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data, used for parsing and tokenization.
  

The projects that the course proposed to build are:

  0.a. [***Degrees***](https://github.com/sshmo/Python-AI/tree/master/Projects/p0/degrees)

      Write a program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are.
  
  0.b. [***Tic-Tac-Toe***](https://github.com/sshmo/Python-AI/tree/master/Projects/p0/tictactoe)

      Using Minimax, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.
